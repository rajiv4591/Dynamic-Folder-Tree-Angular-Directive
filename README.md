# Dynamic-Folder-Tree-Angular-Directive
A custom angular directive to generate a dynamic folder tree which can have any number and levels of folders and sub folders. 
Unlike other folder tree directives, this directive does not have all the tree details initially. 
Each level is obtained dynamically by making a call to an api on clicking its parent.
